Alright, so russian invasion of Ukraine put my way of the game designer and coder on-hold. 
I was I was working on some code-not related jobs in order to provide my family, and was not really in a mood or in 
a good fit to keep learning. But now the situation is a bit more stable now and I have some free time along the weekends,
so let us be brave (or foolish :) enough to make some road-map for myself in order to finish my first real game. 

At this moment the core game play is done, but there are still a lot of things to do in order to make it playeble. Even though the
game by itself is quite simple. So here is a todo list: 

MVP
- Better UI;
- Sound FX;
- Main menu (Art + UI functional aka "New Game", "Credits");
- Intro (video);
- Difficulty progress mechanic;
- Refactoring asteroid spawn mechanic, make it impossible to overlap with each other;
- Win conditions;

Additional stuff
- Refactoring for the shooting system and asteroids;
- New background art;
- Audio lines for the Assistant and plot development (I have some ideas here, it will note change game much, justy tinny little things for myself :) )
- Additional weapon aka Ultimate
